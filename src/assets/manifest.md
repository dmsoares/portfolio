# Title

I started my adventure in web developing and IT in June 15, 2018.
It was the day I completed my first [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) challenge and learned to 'Say hello to HTML elements'!

After an interim to start a small business with my wife in an unrelated field (I still had fun setting up our wordpress website, though!), I decided in early 2020 that I would take this career path seriously and would invest all my time and effort to land a job as a software developer.

By then I had already finished freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification and was half way through their Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures one. I went ahead, completing both the Javascript module and the Front End Libraries Certification. All while following along Harvards's CS50 on Youtube! You can check [my FCC's profile here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/dmsoares).

The next step was doing App Brewery's [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-7daa232b-c48f-4b07-8fe3-3e15804fefaf/), on Udemy. While probably no one becomes a developer by just completing one online course (or several, to be fair), this online bootcamp enabled me to have a broad sense of what technologies and stacks could serve as an entry point to web development.

I have decided to specialize in component based development using React. I have read and watched countless articles on this framework, including the official documentation and have since applied it to all my projects.

I am deeply passionate about learning and expanding my own abilities and most of all I care about diving into things in search of fundamental insights while having a holistic perspective on stuff. That's something that I had the opportunity to develop while at university doing my Anthropology and Philosophy studies.

As such, my priority in this last few months, along with React, as been to get to know how the browser does its job, how its different threads work and communicate between them and how javascript is interpreted. How come javascript's single threaded, synchronous execution context can order network requests while responding to user input and manipulating the DOM? I remember trying to wrap my head around this one! 

I don't mind getting lost in technical docs and love to feel desoriented by just the right amount before arriving to new knowledge!

Of course all this time and energy wouldn't make sense without getting my hands dirty coding. Please check my [Github profile](https://www.github.com/dmsoares). Go to the Projects repo to see how I handled freeCodeCamp's project challenges or how I responded to Significa's call to code a Netflix-esque front page with React!
Visit the [fullstackopen-exercises](https://github.com/dmsoares/fullstack-open-exercises) repo and you can also see how I am currently doing on [Fullstack Open curriculum](https://fullstackopen.com/en).

My journey thus far has allowed me to learn different skills such as:
  Responsive Design
  HTML
  CSS
  Javascript ES6
  React
  MongoDb
